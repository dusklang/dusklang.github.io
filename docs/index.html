                <h1>The Dusk Programming Language</h1>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                My name is Zach Wolfe. I started building Dusk for the same reason many things are built: I was frustrated with the existing alternatives. Every language I have ever tried has some aspects I appreciate, and others that consistently get in my way. My goal with Dusk is two-fold: one, to make a language that enables me to build high-quality software with as little frustration&mdash;and as much assistance&mdash;as possible, and two, to make the compiler and associated tools as high-quality as possible. I have more detailed thoughts than that, but I would prefer to focus on building more of the language before I share them.

                <p style="color:red">Note: neither this blog nor the language it is about are ready for prime-time. <a href="https://github.com/dusklang/dusk">Use Dusk</a> at your own risk!</p>
